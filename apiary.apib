          "psalm_proverbs": "<h2>1. Respect<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A culture of respect underlies the book of Proverbs. We see three examples in this passage:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Respect for the Lord<br \/>\r\n\t&lsquo;An honest life shows <em>respect <\/em>for God&rsquo; (14:2, MSG). As we have seen, the word &lsquo;fear&rsquo; (NIV) is probably best understood as &lsquo;respect&rsquo;. Respect for the Lord is the starting point for respect in all our other relationships.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Respect for the wise<br \/>\r\n\t&lsquo;Whoever walks with the wise grows wise&rsquo; (13:20). &lsquo;Wise speech evokes nothing but <em>respect<\/em>&rsquo; (14:3, MSG). Our society increasingly devalues the wisdom that comes with age. Wisdom often (though not always) comes through the experience of a long life. There is a huge amount of untapped wisdom in older people in our society.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Respect in the home<br \/>\r\n\t&lsquo;A refusal to correct is a refusal to love; love your children by disciplining them&rsquo; (13:24, MSG). This teaching has sometimes been abused by an over-literal interpretation. What the book of Proverbs is encouraging is a culture of respect in the family &ndash; respect for parents and also respect for children, which involves loving discipline.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rteindent1\">As St Paul writes, &lsquo;Do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord&rsquo; (Ephesians 6:4).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Lord, help us to gain wisdom as we spend time with those who are wise. Help us as a church community to model good parenting, combining love and discipline. Help us to live lives of uprightness in respect for the Lord.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n",
          "new_testament": "<h2>2. Awe<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus really was raised from the dead. The tomb really was empty on Easter morning. Jesus&rsquo; followers really did meet him alive again. The resurrection did happen. The best historical explanation for the origin of Christianity is that it really is true. Jesus is alive today!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>John records four resurrection appearances of Jesus &ndash; the first three of which are in this passage. In these appearances we see not only some of the evidence, but also some of the results of the resurrection.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Awe and amazement<br \/>\r\n\tIn the culture of the day, a woman&rsquo;s testimony would not have been considered as weighty as that of a man. If the disciples had been making this up, they would not have devised the first appearance as being to Mary Magdalene.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rteindent1\">This shows a huge amount about Jesus&rsquo; respect for women. By this act, and others during his life on earth, he laid the foundation for a revolution in the world&rsquo;s attitude to women. Sadly, it has taken 2,000 years and we are still not there yet.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rteindent1\">Jesus does not ask Mary what she is looking for. He asks, &lsquo;<em>Who <\/em>is it you are you looking for?&rsquo; (v.15). It is not enough to know the evidence of the facts of the resurrection. We need a personal encounter with the resurrected Jesus.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rteindent1\">The respect goes both ways. In Mary&rsquo;s case it is one of awe and amazement. As she realised it was Jesus, she cried out in Aramaic, &lsquo;&ldquo;Rabboni!&rdquo; (which means Teacher)&rsquo; (v.16), and rushed off to tell the disciples, &lsquo;I have seen the Lord!&rsquo; (v.18).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rteindent1\">The great theologian, C. H. Dodd, wrote of Jesus&rsquo; appearance to Mary that it &lsquo;has something indefinably firsthand about it. It stands in any case alone. There is nothing quite like it in the Gospels. Is there anything quite like it in all ancient literature?&rsquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Joy and peace<br \/>\r\n\tThe world is desperately searching for happiness and peace of mind. The supreme source of joy and peace is a relationship with Jesus.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rteindent1\">Jesus&rsquo; appearance to the disciples brought them overwhelming joy: &lsquo;The disciples were <em>overjoyed <\/em>when they saw the Lord&rsquo; (v.20). Three times he says to them, &lsquo;<em>Peace <\/em>be with you!&rsquo; (vv.19,21,26).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rteindent1\">Faith in Jesus brings joy and peace to all who believe. Jesus said to Thomas, &lsquo;Blessed and <em>happy <\/em>and to be envied are those who have never seen me and yet have believed and adhered to and trusted and relied on me&rsquo; (v.29, AMP).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Purpose and power<br \/>\r\n\tJesus gives them a new sense of purpose: &lsquo;As the Father has sent me, I am sending you&rsquo; (v.21). The resurrection is the message of hope for the world. If this life were all there was, it would ultimately be meaningless and purposeless. But Jesus Christ is risen from the dead. There is life beyond the grave. This gives your life on earth a whole new meaning and purpose. You are sent out by Jesus to proclaim this message to the world.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rteindent1\">Finally, he also gave them power. He &lsquo;breathed on them and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of anyone, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven&rdquo;&rsquo; (vv.22&ndash;23). The Holy Spirit provides the strength and ability for you to forgive.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rteindent1\">The same power that raised Jesus from the dead is available to you. He gives you the power of his Holy Spirit and the power of his word to declare the message of God&rsquo;s forgiveness to human beings. This is the message that brings eternal life.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Respect and reverence<br \/>\r\n\tThomas was a cynic; sceptical and full of doubt. I think I would probably have had the same response as him when he said, &lsquo;Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it&rsquo; (v.25).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rteindent1\">He must have felt so stupid when Jesus appeared to him and said, &lsquo;Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe&rsquo; (v.27).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rteindent1\">Do not feel guilty about having doubts. Like Thomas, be honest about your doubts and bring them to Jesus. When Jesus answered his doubts, Thomas&rsquo; response was the pinnacle of respect, reverence and awe. He said, &lsquo;My Lord and my God!&rsquo; (v.28). From a place of having doubted, Thomas makes perhaps the strongest statement of Jesus&rsquo; divinity in all of the Gospels. He is the first person to look at Jesus and call him &lsquo;God&rsquo;. He said, in effect, &lsquo;Wow!&rsquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rteindent1\">Jesus went on to tell him that belief leads to blessing (v.29). In fact, it leads to life. Belief and life go hand in hand in John&rsquo;s Gospel (v.31), because, if you believe in Jesus you have life. This is <em>real <\/em>life of high quality, an abundant life (10:10) that goes on forever (3:16).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"rteindent1\">John&rsquo;s whole reason for writing his Gospel was so that &lsquo;you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name&rsquo; (20:31). As Tom Wright puts it, &lsquo;Resurrection is the ground of Christian hope for life <em>before death<\/em>, as well as beyond it.&rsquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Jesus, my Lord and my God, today I worship you with awe and reverence.

          "old_testament": "<h2>3. Reverence<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>David&rsquo;s attitude to Saul is a wonderful example of how to respond to those who try to do you harm. David did not seek revenge. He was not bitter. He treated Saul with the utmost respect. After all, God had used Saul greatly in the past. The fact that Saul had gone off the rails did not erase David&rsquo;s respect.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>His attitude to Saul was quite extraordinary. He said to the Amalekite who claimed to have finished off Saul, &lsquo;Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the Lord&rsquo;s anointed?&rsquo; (v.14). In the light of 1 Samuel 31, the Amalekite may well have been trying to benefit from what would have been a perversion of the facts. He may have been a human vulture, who took the royal insignia from Saul to gain favour with David. In any event, it did him no good because of David&rsquo;s reverence for Saul.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>David grieved over the death of his great friend Jonathan and over Saul (2 Samuel 1:19&ndash;27). Grief is a natural, necessary and healthy response to the death of those we love.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supremely, David reverenced God. He &lsquo;enquired of the Lord&rsquo; (2:1). He asked, &lsquo;Shall I go up to one of the towns of Judah?&rsquo; The Lord answered, &lsquo;Go up.&rsquo; He then asked, &lsquo;Where shall I go?&rsquo; The Lord answered, &lsquo;To Hebron.&rsquo; David obeyed and was anointed king over the house of Judah.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Lord, help us to have the same love that David had for all those you have anointed in leadership roles, whether they support us or whether they don&rsquo;t. Help us never to take revenge but always to treat people with respect. Help us, most of all, to live a life of reverence and respect and obedience to you.<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n",

Even though the Lord has not sent them, they say, “The Lord declares,” and expect him to fulfill their words. <sup class="versenum">7 </sup>Have you not seen false visions and uttered lying divinations when you say, “The Lord declares,” though I have not spoken?</p> <p><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because of your false words and lying visions, I am against you, declares the Sovereign Lord. <sup class="versenum">9 </sup>My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations.

They alone would be saved, but the land would be desolate. </p> <p><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>“Or if I bring a sword against that country and say, ‘Let the sword pass throughout the land,’ and I kill its people and their animals, <sup class="versenum">18 </sup>as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, even if these three men were in it, they could not save their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved.</p> <p><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>“Or if I send a plague into that land and pour out my wrath on it through bloodshed, killing its people and their animals, <sup class="versenum">20 </sup>as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, even if Noah, Daniel and Job were in it, they could save neither son nor daughter. They would save only themselves by their righteousness. </p> <p><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>“For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: How much worse will it be when I send against Jerusalem my four dreadful judgments —sword and famine and wild beasts and plague —to kill its men and their animals! <sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Yet there will be some survivors —sons and daughters who will be brought out of it. They will come to you, and when you see their conduct and their actions, you will be consoled regarding the disaster I have brought on Jerusalem—every disaster I have brought on it. <sup class="versenum">23 </sup>You will be consoled when you see their conduct and their actions, for you will know that I have done nothing in it without cause, declares the Sovereign Lord. ”</p> <h3>Jerusalem as a Useless Vine</h3><p class="chapter-2"><strong>15 </strong>The word of the Lord came to me: <sup class="versenum">2 </sup>“Son of man, how is the wood of a vine different from that of a branch from any of the trees in the forest? <sup class="versenum">3 </sup>Is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful? Do they make pegs from it to hang things on? <sup class="versenum">4 </sup>And after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything? <sup class="versenum">5 </sup>If it was not useful for anything when it was whole, how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred?</p> <p><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>“Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: As I have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire, so will I treat the people living in Jerusalem. <sup class="versenum">7 </sup>I will set my face against them. Although they have come out of the fire , the fire will yet consume them.

        psalm_proverbs: "<h2>1. A peaceful community</h2> <p>We live in a world full of aggression, division and broken relationships.</p> <p>One of the main reasons for loneliness is &lsquo;quarrelling&rsquo; (v.6, MSG), which leads to the breakdown of relationships. We see this wherever we look &ndash; broken marriages, family bust-ups, fall-outs between friends, work colleagues and neighbours.</p> <p>Adam and Eve&rsquo;s friendship with God was broken. This led to a separation between Adam and Eve themselves. Cain and Abel quarrelled, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p> <p>The psalmist is feeling isolated as though living in a foreign land (v.5). He is surrounded by lying lips and deceitful tongues (v.2). The people he lives among hate peace (v.6) and are for war (v.7). He feels doomed to live his whole life among &lsquo;quarrelling neighbours&rsquo; (v.6, MSG).</p> <p>In his distress he calls out to the Lord to save him and the Lord answers him (v.1). He describes himself in contrast to those around him as a man of peace (v.7). This is the characteristic of the people of God: Jesus said, &lsquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God&rsquo; (Matthew 5:9).</p> <blockquote> <p>Lord, help me to avoid unnecessary quarrelling and to be a peacemaker in my family, workplace and community.</p> </blockquote> ",
        new_testament: "<h2>2. A &lsquo;new&rsquo; community</h2> <p>&lsquo;The local church is the hope for the world,&rsquo; writes Bill Hybels. The church in the New Testament is described as &lsquo;the people of God&rsquo;. The people of God gather in local churches all over the world. The writer of Hebrews quotes the book of Jeremiah saying, &lsquo;I will be their God, and they will be<em> my people</em>&rsquo; (v.10). No longer isolated and alone, we are part of the most amazing community.</p> <p>In the Old Testament, God made a covenant with his people. However, the people did not &lsquo;keep their part of the bargain&rsquo; (v.9, MSG). God promised that one day he would make a new covenant, whereby he would have a new relationship with his people: &lsquo;I will be their God, and they will be <em>my people</em>&rsquo; (v.10).</p> <p>The people of God are far better off now than they were under the old covenant. The writer goes on to say, &lsquo;The ministry Jesus has received is as <em>superior </em>to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is <em>superior </em>to the old one, and it is founded on <em>better promises</em>&rsquo; (v.6).</p> <p>There was a problem with the old covenant, for &lsquo;if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another&rsquo; (v.7). The problem with the old covenant was that the people were unable to keep the law. They &lsquo;did not remain faithful&rsquo; (v.9).</p> <p>God promised a new covenant that would be superior to the old one and founded on better promises. The writer goes back to the book of Jeremiah, and quotes 31:31&ndash;34.</p> <p>What were these promises? They are fourfold:</p> <ul> <li>New heart<br /> God promises to implant his laws in your heart. This does not mean simply committing the law to memory (as per Deuteronomy 6:6&ndash;9). It means having a new heart, &lsquo;I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts&rsquo; (Hebrews 8:10b).</li> <li>Firsthand knowledge<br /> He promises that the knowledge of God will be a matter of personal experience. &lsquo;No longer will they teach their neighbours, or say to one another, &ldquo;Know the Lord,&rdquo; because they will all know me&rsquo; (v.11). It is possible for all of us to know God in the way that Jeremiah knew God: &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll all get to know me firsthand&rsquo; (v.11, MSG).</li> <li>Universal scope<br /> &lsquo;They will <em>all </em>know me, from the least of them to the greatest&rsquo; (v.11b). This was a fulfilment of the promise in the Old Testament that the promise would no longer be confined to Israel and Judah but would extend to all nations (Isaiah 42:6; 49:6; 19:24).</li> <li>Total forgiveness<br /> &lsquo;For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more&rsquo; (Hebrews 8:12). For the Hebrews, the word &lsquo;remembering&rsquo; meant more than mental effort; it carried with it the sense of doing something to the advantage or disadvantage of the person who remembered. If your sins are not remembered, it means that God is determined to forgive and that the &lsquo;slate&rsquo; of your sins is &lsquo;forever wiped clean&rsquo; (v.12, MSG). All this is possible because Jesus offered his life for you (v.13).</li> </ul> <p>This new covenant is far superior and &lsquo;has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and ageing will soon disappear&rsquo; (v.13)</p> <p>The new covenant is the basis of the new community into which God calls you. This new covenant is the answer to loneliness. The covenant is with God&rsquo;s people together, and not solely with each person as individuals. The promises are all in the plural. You have the immense privilege of belonging to the new community of God&rsquo;s people. You know God personally. Your sins are forgiven. The Holy Spirit has come to live within you and given you a new heart. You are never alone.</p> <blockquote> <p>Father, thank you that I can experience a personal relationship with you &ndash; that I can know you. Thank you that I am part of the most wonderful community of the people of God. Thank you that I am never alone.</p> </blockquote> ",
        old_testament: "<h2>3. A faithful community</h2> <p>The great idols of our age are money, sex and power. But an idol can be anything we worship by giving it more attention and treating it as more important than God in our lives. It could be our home, car or possessions but it could also be our work or ministry. When we make an idol out of any of these things, it takes us away from God (14:14).</p> <p>God is looking for people who are faithful to him. The problem under the old covenant was that &lsquo;they <em>did not remain faithful</em>&rsquo; (Hebrews 8:9). In this passage we see an example of what that meant. God spoke through Ezekiel about a country that &lsquo;sins against me by being <em>unfaithful</em>&hellip; they have been <em>unfaithful</em>, declares the Sovereign Lord&rsquo; (Ezekiel 14:13; 15:8).</p> <p>Ezekiel, the prophet, saw ahead to what we have read about in our New Testament passage for today. He foresaw a time when the people &lsquo;will not defile themselves any more with all their sins. They will be <em>my people</em>, and I will be their God, declares the Sovereign Lord&rsquo; (14:11).</p> <p>God&rsquo;s people were ensnared by lies. As we read in the psalm about &lsquo;lying lips&rsquo; (Psalm 120:2), so we read here about lying prophets &lsquo;who prophesy out of their own imagination&rsquo; (Ezekiel 13:2). &lsquo;Their visions are false and their divinations a lie&rsquo; (v.6). Using &lsquo;magic charms&rsquo; they &lsquo;ensnare people&rsquo; (v.18). They lie &lsquo;to my people, who listen to lies&rsquo; (v.19). They dishearten the righteous with their lies (v.22).</p> <p>How had they been unfaithful? The Lord said that they &lsquo;set up idols in their hearts and put wicked stumbling-blocks before their faces&rsquo; (14:3). Even in the Old Testament, the Lord was not concerned only about physical idols &ndash; but also about the idols in people&rsquo;s hearts. God&rsquo;s longing is for us to be a faithful vine bearing good fruit (chapter 15; see also Isaiah 5:1&ndash;7).</p> <p>You are called to be part of a faithful community of the people of God who know and love God. We are to welcome everyone &lsquo;from the least of them to the greatest&rsquo; (Hebrews 8:11). We are called to be a community where many lonely, isolated people find love and forgiveness &ndash; a community of the people of God&nbsp;&ndash; a people of peace who know and love the Lord and are faithful to him in every way. This is the answer to loneliness.</p> <blockquote> <p>Lord, help me to be faithful to you. Help us to be a loving, peaceful and faithful community where many isolated and lonely people come to know you and find, in the community of God&rsquo;s people, the answer to loneliness.</p> </blockquote> ",

                "introduction": "<p>In 2007, a group of twenty-three South Korean missionaries were captured by the Taliban in Afghanistan. They were terrified. The Taliban separated the group, isolated them and confiscated their possessions. One of the Korean women managed to hold on to her Bible. She ripped it into twenty-three pieces and secretly gave each of them a portion so that wherever they were, each person could read a part of Scripture when no one was watching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group knew that the Taliban had decided to kill them, one at a time. One by one the missionaries surrendered their lives again to Jesus saying, &lsquo;Lord, if you want me to die for your sake I&rsquo;ll do it.&rsquo; Then the pastor said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve talked to [the Taliban] because they are going to start killing us and I&rsquo;ve told their leaders that if anyone dies, I die first because I am your pastor.&rsquo; Another said, &lsquo;No, because I also am a pastor and I am your <em>elder</em>. I die first.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then the pastor came back and said, &lsquo;You are not ordained, I have been ordained, I die first.&rsquo; And sure enough, he died first. Two more were killed before the rest were eventually rescued. They had demonstrated extraordinary loyalty to God and to each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The South Korean missionaries were following in the footsteps of the apostles who, as we see in today&rsquo;s New Testament passage, showed extraordinary loyalty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loyalty is a combination of love and faithfulness. It is a quality often lacking in our society today. Disloyalty destroys families, churches, businesses, political parties and even nations. Each of the passages today says something about this quality of loyalty.</p>\r\n",
                "psalm_proverbs": "<h2>1. Loyalty to God in our plans</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Our first loyalty is to God. His favour rests on those who are &lsquo;God-loyal&rsquo; (v.19, MSG).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book of Proverbs is full of practical wisdom. It encourages you, for example, to be discerning about what you believe: &lsquo;The gullible believe anything they&rsquo;re told; the prudent sift and weigh every word&rsquo; (v.15, MSG). Ultimately wisdom is about how you relate to God: &lsquo;The wise fear the Lord and shun evil&rsquo; (v.16).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Fear of the Lord&rsquo; is an attitude of healthy respect and loyalty. It means involving him in all your plans. We need to be very careful about the plans we make &ndash; that they are for good and not for evil. Eventually, even &lsquo;the wicked will respect God-<em>loyal </em>people&rsquo; (v.19, MSG).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;But those who plan what is good find <em>love </em>and <em>faithfulness</em>&rsquo; (v.22b). The word for &lsquo;find&rsquo; is sometimes translated &lsquo;show&rsquo;. Both are true. Those who plan what is good not only <em>find </em>love and faithfulness, they <em>show </em>love and faithfulness as well. This is at the heart of loyalty &ndash; to show love and faithfulness. This is contrasted with those who selfishly plot evil and go astray.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Lord, help me to be wise and God-loyal in my plans. Show me more ways to be kind to the needy. May we, as a community of God-loyal people, plan what is good and find love and faithfulness.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n",
                "new_testament": "<h2>2. Loyalty to Jesus in our words</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As the apostles went out and preached the good news they performed <em>many </em>miraculous signs and wonders among the people. &lsquo;More and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number&rsquo; (v.14). As a result, &lsquo;Crowds gathered&hellip; bringing their sick&hellip; <em>all </em>of them were healed&rsquo; (vv.15&ndash;16).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly, their success led to &lsquo;jealousy&rsquo; from religious leaders (v.17). Once again we see how envy is such a temptation for those of us who are seen as religious. In their jealousy they arrested the apostles and put them in jail (v.18). But once again God performed a miracle. He sent an angel of the Lord to open the doors of the jail and bring them out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With huge courage they obeyed the command to &lsquo;Go, stand in the temple courts&hellip; and tell the people the full message of this new life&rsquo; (v.20).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When they were caught doing exactly what they had been arrested for doing in the first place, they were re-arrested and brought before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest who said to them, &lsquo;We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name&hellip; Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man&rsquo;s blood&rsquo; (v.28).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter and the other apostles were loyal to God and to their calling. They replied, &lsquo;We must obey God rather than human beings!&rsquo; (v.29).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus said, &lsquo;Give to Caesar what is Caesar&rsquo;s,&nbsp;and to God what is God&rsquo;s&rsquo; (Matthew 22:21). In saying this, he defined the limits of loyalty to the authority of human beings. When it conflicts with loyalty to God, God takes precedence. Out of loyalty to God, they continued preaching the gospel &ndash; even when they were on trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The brief sermon (it takes only three verses &ndash; Acts 5:30&ndash;32) is all about Jesus. They preach about the cross, resurrection and the exaltation of Jesus. They proclaimed Jesus as Prince and Saviour. The talk includes a description of the way of salvation: repentance and forgiveness of sins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition they managed to include the whole Trinity. God the Father: &lsquo;The God of our ancestors (v.30), God the Son: &lsquo;Jesus&rsquo; (v.30) and God &lsquo;the Holy Spirit&rsquo; (v.32). This sermon produces such fury that, like the South Korean missionaries, they faced the threat of death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in the providence of God, there was a wise man on the Sanhedrin, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, who pointed out to his fellow members (by giving examples from recent history) that &lsquo;if [the apostles&rsquo;] purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail. But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God&rsquo; (vv.38&ndash;39).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although his speech persuaded them, nevertheless the apostles were flogged and &lsquo;ordered&hellip; not to speak in the name of Jesus&rsquo; (v.40).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, with extraordinary courage and loyalty to God and their calling, &lsquo;The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming<em> the good news that Jesus is the Christ</em>&rsquo; (vv.41&ndash;42).</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Lord, may we be inspired by the example of the apostles and those like the South Korean missionaries who followed in their footsteps. Help us to demonstrate loyalty to you regardless of the circumstances and opposition around us. May we never stop teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n",
                "old_testament": "<h2>3. Loyalty to each other in our hearts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Loyalty is such an attractive characteristic in a person. Disloyalty is subversive and betrays trust. Disloyalty can undermine the leadership in a church, business or even a nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In David&rsquo;s case, disloyalty came from his own son. This must have been so painful for him. David loved Absalom; &lsquo;the king&rsquo;s heart longed for Absalom&rsquo; (14:1). God speaks to David through the wise woman from Tekoa. As a result David says, &lsquo;Go, bring back the young man Absalom&rsquo; (v.21). When he returned &lsquo;the king kissed Absalom&rsquo; (v.33). David gave him another opportunity to be a loyal son.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tragically, David&rsquo;s love and loyalty to Absalom were not returned. We see here a powerful description of how disloyalty works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are always opportunities for disloyalty. In any situation &ndash; whether for example in the government, workplace or the church &ndash; there are bound to be those who complain (15:2). If you are a loyal person you will help to deal with these complaints and attempt to diffuse them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has been said, &lsquo;Loyalty means I am down with you whether you are wrong or right. But I will tell you when you are wrong and help you get it right.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Absalom failed the loyalty test. He would say to the complainers,&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&lsquo;&ldquo;Look, you&rsquo;ve got a strong case; but the king isn&rsquo;t going to listen to you.&rdquo; Then he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t someone make me a judge for this country? Anybody with a case could bring it to me and I&rsquo;d settle things fair and square.&rdquo;&rsquo; (vv.3&ndash;4, MSG).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, this is absolute nonsense. But it is easy to make promises of this kind. The disloyal person says, &lsquo;If only I were in charge everything would be so much better.&rsquo; In this way Absalom &lsquo;<em>stole the hearts of the people of Israel</em>&rsquo; (v.6). Disloyalty begins in our hearts and in our thinking. So does loyalty. Guard your heart and your thinking and do not allow your heart to be stolen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who are feeling discontented in any situation always look for a rallying point. They look for someone among the leadership team whom they can rally around. If the entire leadership team remains faithful, the discontents will be unsuccessful. However, here they found a rallying point around Absalom and &lsquo;the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom&rsquo;s following kept on increasing&rsquo; (v.12).</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Lord, help us to stay loyal to our leaders &ndash; to our national leaders and governments, parents, church leaders and bosses. Lord, guard our hearts, keep us loyal to you and to one another. May loyalty, love and faithfulness always be characteristics of our community.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n",

The Taliban separated the group, isolated them and confiscated their possessions. One of the Korean women managed to hold on to her Bible. She ripped it into twenty-three pieces and secretly gave each of them a portion so that wherever they were, each person could read a part of Scripture when no one was watching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group knew that the Taliban had decided to kill them, one at a time. One by one the missionaries surrendered their lives again to Jesus saying, &lsquo;Lord, if you want me to die for your sake I&rsquo;ll do it.&rsquo; Then the pastor said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve talked to [the Taliban] because they are going to start killing us and I&rsquo;ve told their leaders that if anyone dies, I die first because I am your pastor.&rsquo; Another said, &lsquo;No, because I also am a pastor and I am your <em>elder</em>. I die first.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then the pastor came back and said, &lsquo;You are not ordained, I have been ordained, I die first.&rsquo; And sure enough, he died first. Two more were killed before the rest were eventually rescued. They had demonstrated extraordinary loyalty to God and to each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The South Korean missionaries were following in the footsteps of the apostles who, as we see in today&rsquo;s New Testament passage, showed extraordinary loyalty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loyalty is a combination of love and faithfulness. It is a quality often lacking in our society today. Disloyalty destroys families, churches, businesses, political parties and even nations. Each of the passages today says something about this quality of loyalty.</p>\r\n",

His favour rests on those who are &lsquo;God-loyal&rsquo; (v.19, MSG).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book of Proverbs is full of practical wisdom. It encourages you, for example, to be discerning about what you believe: &lsquo;The gullible believe anything they&rsquo;re told; the prudent sift and weigh every word&rsquo; (v.15, MSG). Ultimately wisdom is about how you relate to God: &lsquo;The wise fear the Lord and shun evil&rsquo; (v.16).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Fear of the Lord&rsquo; is an attitude of healthy respect and loyalty. It means involving him in all your plans. We need to be very careful about the plans we make &ndash; that they are for good and not for evil. Eventually, even &lsquo;the wicked will respect God-<em>loyal </em>people&rsquo; (v.19, MSG).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;But those who plan what is good find <em>love </em>and <em>faithfulness</em>&rsquo; (v.22b). The word for &lsquo;find&rsquo; is sometimes translated &lsquo;show&rsquo;. Both are true. Those who plan what is good not only <em>find </em>love and faithfulness, they <em>show </em>love and faithfulness as well. This is at the heart of loyalty &ndash; to show love and faithfulness. This is contrasted with those who selfishly plot evil and go astray.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Lord, help me to be wise and God-loyal in my plans. Show me more ways to be kind to the needy. May we, as a community of God-loyal people, plan what is good and find love and faithfulness.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n",
                "new_testament": "<h2>2. Loyalty to Jesus in our words</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As the apostles went out and preached the good news they performed <em>many </em>miraculous signs and wonders among the people. &lsquo;More and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number&rsquo; (v.14). As a result, &lsquo;Crowds gathered&hellip; bringing their sick&hellip; <em>all </em>of them were healed&rsquo; (vv.15&ndash;16).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly, their success led to &lsquo;jealousy&rsquo; from religious leaders (v.17). Once again we see how envy is such a temptation for those of us who are seen as religious. In their jealousy they arrested the apostles and put them in jail (v.18). But once again God performed a miracle. He sent an angel of the Lord to open the doors of the jail and bring them out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With huge courage they obeyed the command to &lsquo;Go, stand in the temple courts&hellip; and tell the people the full message of this new life&rsquo; (v.20).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When they were caught doing exactly what they had been arrested for doing in the first place, they were re-arrested and brought before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest who said to them, &lsquo;We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name&hellip; Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man&rsquo;s blood&rsquo; (v.28).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter and the other apostles were loyal to God and to their calling. They replied, &lsquo;We must obey God rather than human beings!&rsquo; (v.29).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus said, &lsquo;Give to Caesar what is Caesar&rsquo;s,&nbsp;and to God what is God&rsquo;s&rsquo; (Matthew 22:21). In saying this, he defined the limits of loyalty to the authority of human beings. When it conflicts with loyalty to God, God takes precedence. Out of loyalty to God, they continued preaching the gospel &ndash; even when they were on trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The brief sermon (it takes only three verses &ndash; Acts 5:30&ndash;32) is all about Jesus. They preach about the cross, resurrection and the exaltation of Jesus. They proclaimed Jesus as Prince and Saviour. The talk includes a description of the way of salvation: repentance and forgiveness of sins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition they managed to include the whole Trinity. God the Father: &lsquo;The God of our ancestors (v.30), God the Son: &lsquo;Jesus&rsquo; (v.30) and God &lsquo;the Holy Spirit&rsquo; (v.32). This sermon produces such fury that, like the South Korean missionaries, they faced the threat of death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in the providence of God, there was a wise man on the Sanhedrin, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, who pointed out to his fellow members (by giving examples from recent history) that &lsquo;if [the apostles&rsquo;] purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail. But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God&rsquo; (vv.38&ndash;39).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although his speech persuaded them, nevertheless the apostles were flogged and &lsquo;ordered&hellip; not to speak in the name of Jesus&rsquo; (v.40).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, with extraordinary courage and loyalty to God and their calling, &lsquo;The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming<em> the good news that Jesus is the Christ</em>&rsquo; (vv.41&ndash;42).</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Lord, may we be inspired by the example of the apostles and those like the South Korean missionaries who followed in their footsteps. Help us to demonstrate loyalty to you regardless of the circumstances and opposition around us. May we never stop teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n",

Therefore, the only obvious career move in those days for a man of his background was to become a clergyman in the Church of England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He tried to make himself acceptable to God by keeping the whole law, inwardly and outwardly. He got up early. He prayed. He denied himself. He tried to earn forgiveness and peace by increased effort. But he &lsquo;groaned under a heavy yoke&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 24 May, 1738 at 8.45am he heard someone reading a book by the great reformer, Martin Luther. He later recalled, &lsquo;While he was describing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, <em>I felt my heart strangely warmed</em>. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for salvation; and an assurance was given [to] me that He had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John Wesley became one of the greatest preachers ever, preaching over 40,000 sermons centred on freedom through faith in Jesus Christ. He had, as he put it, &lsquo;<em>exchanged the faith of a servant for the faith of a son</em>&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus Christ is the supreme liberator, and becoming a Christian is the supreme act of liberation. &lsquo;Freedom&rsquo; is the word that best sums up the Christian life.</p>\r\n",

To be saved is to be <em>set free</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are facing some difficult challenge in your life, pray like David:<br />\r\n&lsquo;Give us help for the hard task;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; human help is worthless.<br />\r\nIn God we&rsquo;ll do our very best&rsquo;<br />\r\n(vv.12&ndash;13a, MSG).</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Lord, thank you that you love me, help me and set me free.

His message is that we are not &lsquo;born free&rsquo; but that in order to be free, we must be &lsquo;born again&rsquo;. True freedom is found in a life of faith in Christ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many ideas of freedom fail because they do not realise the true nature of our captivity. A belief in freedom as the birthright of a particular group of people has often given birth to malignant nationalism and racism. It has produced some of the gravest evils of recent times, including Nazism and Apartheid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The title of the film <em>Cry Freedom </em>expresses something we all long for. Whether it&rsquo;s racial and political freedom (as in the case of this film), free speech, free assembly, free worship, a free conscience, or economic freedom and individual freedom, the whole world cries out for freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of these forms of freedom are important, but you can have them all and still be in slavery. Alternatively, you can have none of them but still be free. The gospel contains within it the promise of other forms of freedom, but it begins with a freedom that is more profound than any other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Christ has set us free to live a free life&rsquo; (5:1, MSG). Jesus sets us free to live a life of freedom, faith and love through the Spirit. Paul&rsquo;s opponents, &lsquo;the Judaisers&rsquo;, boasted about the fact that they were Abraham&rsquo;s children. Paul used an allegorical argument to confront them. (It is interesting to note in passing that Paul was quite happy to interpret the Old Testament figuratively (4:24).)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul said to his opponents that there are two ways in which we can live &ndash; in bondage or in freedom. He explains that there are two covenants: &lsquo;You boast of being Abraham&rsquo;s children &ndash; but Abraham actually had two children &ndash; one in bondage and one in freedom.&rsquo; True descent from Abraham is not physical, but spiritual. It is not enough to have Abraham as your father. The crucial question is, &lsquo;Who is your mother?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He argued that by his opponents&rsquo; insistence on the law, they were, in fact, children of Hagar. This analogy represents the old covenant, the present city of Jerusalem, Ishmael, the child of the flesh, and a life of bondage (v.25). This is the life John Wesley experienced before his conversion. It is a life of frustration and failure, confusion and defeat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be a Christian, on the other hand, is to be a child not only of Abraham, but also of Sarah. Sarah represents the new covenant, the new Jerusalem (&lsquo;the Jerusalem that is above&rsquo;, v.26), Isaac (the child of promise, v.28) and the freedom that is in Christ. This is what Wesley experienced the day he trusted in Christ and Christ alone for salvation. His heart was &lsquo;strangely warmed&rsquo;. This is the way of peace, joy and freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incidentally, this passage is the origin of Mothering Sunday &ndash; which has morphed into Mother&rsquo;s Day. Paul saw the Jerusalem described above as a representation of the Christian church, as foretold in Isaiah 54:1, and &lsquo;she is our mother&rsquo; (Galatians 4:26), i.e. the church is our mother. (Mothering Sunday was originally a day when Christians celebrated the &ldquo;mother church&rdquo;.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul pointed out that just as Ishmael ridiculed Isaac (see Genesis 21:9), the Galatians who are &lsquo;born by the power of the Spirit&rsquo; (v.29) should not be surprised that they are being persecuted by these &lsquo;Judaisers&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He concluded his argument in this section by saying, &lsquo;We are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman&rsquo; (v.31). He continued, &lsquo;It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery&rsquo; (5:1&ndash;2). The picture is of an ox bowed down with a heavy harness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Circumcision&rsquo; was the theological symbol standing for a religion of law (vv.2&ndash;3). Paul argued that to add circumcision is to lose Christ. To seek to be justified by works is to fall away from grace (v.4).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Christian life is a life of faith. We do not work for our salvation; we wait for it (v.5). Meanwhile, &lsquo;The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love&rsquo; (v.6b).</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Lord, thank you for setting me free in order that I might live a life of freedom. Thank you for the freedom the Holy Spirit brings to my life. Help me to express my faith in love today.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n",
                "old_testament": "<h2>3. Tell the good news of freedom</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>God&rsquo;s love extends to every person, of every nation, from the moment of conception onwards. Part of his original plan in choosing Israel was that they would bring his blessing to all people (Genesis 12:3).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God is the creator of the heavens and the earth. He is our maker. There is no other. The book of Isaiah repeats this over and over again for emphasis. Ten times this passage says, &lsquo;There is no other.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God is our maker. He &lsquo;formed you in the womb&rsquo; (Isaiah 44:24). God&rsquo;s love extends before birth to conception and the womb; this has profound implications for how we treat the unborn. Every human being from the moment of conception is created and sustained by God. &lsquo;I have upheld [you] <em>since you were conceived</em>&rsquo; (46:3b).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God&rsquo;s love extends beyond Israel to <em>all the nations </em>as well. Since he is the creator of all, God invites all the nations to participate in salvation and freedom. &lsquo;So turn to me and be helped &ndash; saved! &ndash; everyone, whoever and wherever you are&rsquo; (45:22a, MSG). This promises a freedom greater than any the world can offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, we get a glimpse of the entire world bowing before Jesus. &lsquo;Before me every knee will bow; by me every tongue will swear&rsquo; (v.23b). Paul referred to this verse as a reference to Jesus (Philippians 2:9 onwards).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was a foretaste too, of the fact that God will use people who are &lsquo;Gentiles&rsquo;, that is, non-Jewish. Cyrus was a Persian and yet he is described here as the Lord&rsquo;s anointed (Isaiah 45:1). Isaiah prophesies, &lsquo;I will raise up Cyrus in my righteousness: I will make all his ways straight. He will rebuild my city and set my exiles <em>free</em>&rsquo; (v.13). This prophecy was fulfilled when the exile came to an end through the hand of Cyrus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was God&rsquo;s plan. He said, &lsquo;My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please. From the east I summon a bird of prey; from a far-off land, a man <em>to fulfil my purpose</em>. What I have said, that will I bring about; what <em>I have planned, that will I do</em>&#39; (46:10b&ndash;11). You can be confident that nothing can thwart God&rsquo;s plan for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Lord, thank you that from the moment of conception, you love all people regardless of race or background. Thank you that Jesus has set us free and that, one day, every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n",

I know that freedom myself and have seen many others totally transformed by the reality of this verse. We then have to continue to walk in that freedom and not be tempted back into those old habits, but keep claiming Christ&rsquo;s freedom and the power of the cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>Notes:</h6>\r\n\r\n<h6>Unless otherwise stated, Scripture quotations taken from the Holy Bible, New International Version Anglicised, Copyright &copy; 1979, 1984, 2011 Biblica, formerly International Bible Society.

One represents danger, and the other represents opportunity.&rsquo; Every crisis is, at the same time, an opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of us have problems. Many of us will face crises. How do we respond to a time of trouble, danger or great difficulty? What do we do about a crisis in our personal lives? How do we respond to a crisis in the church or in our nation? What do we do when we are &lsquo;at [our] wits&rsquo; end&rsquo;? (Psalm 107:27). What do we do when the &lsquo;truth of the gospel&rsquo; is at stake? (Galatians 2:5). How do we respond to &lsquo;a black day&rsquo; in our lives? (Isaiah 37:3, MSG).</p>\r\n",
                    "psalm_proverbs": "<h2>1. Cry out to the Lord in prayer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There may be times in your life when you face major storms. A &lsquo;tempest&rsquo; seems to blow and the waves are &lsquo;lifted high&rsquo; (v.25). Your courage melts away (v.26b) and you reach your wits&rsquo; end (vv.26&ndash;27). You hit a crisis and cannot work out how to get out of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This psalm tells us how to respond. The people:<br />\r\n&lsquo;called out to God in [their] desperate condition;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; he got [them] out in the nick of time.<br />\r\nHe quieted the wind down to a whisper,<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; put a muzzle on all the big waves<br />\r\nAnd [they] were so glad when the storm died down,<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; and he led [them] safely back to harbour&rsquo; (vv.28&ndash;30, MSG).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When God answers your cry for help don&rsquo;t forget to thank him:<br />\r\n&lsquo;So thank God for his marvellous love,<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; for his miracle mercy to the children he loves.<br />\r\nLift high your praises when the people assemble,<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; shout Hallelujah when the elders meet!&rsquo; (vv.31&ndash;32, MSG).</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Lord, thank you for the many times you have heard me and rescued me when I cried out to you in my distress. Lord, I cry out to you today for help in my own life &hellip; I cry out to you for the church in this country, for our nation, and for our world.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n",
                    "new_testament": "<h2>2. Use skill, diplomacy and courage</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As we saw yesterday, sometimes we may be tempted to look down on other parts of the church, other denominations or other Christians and wish they were more like us! If only they did things more like us they would be &lsquo;proper&rsquo; Christians or &lsquo;better&rsquo; Christians! In thinking like this we are, in effect, denying that faith in Jesus is enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is what was happening to the churches in Galatia. They were being told that their faith in Jesus was not enough. If they wanted to be &lsquo;real&rsquo; Christians, they needed to be circumcised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The early church was facing a potential crisis, and the apostle Paul had to use every ounce of his skill, diplomacy and courage to avoid a damaging division and split in the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul wants to make clear that he acted under the guidance and activity of the Holy Spirit: &lsquo;I went in response to a revelation&rsquo; (v.2). Paul was convinced of the validity of the gospel he preached, but was also concerned for unity: &lsquo;I did this in private with the leaders &hellip; so that our concern would <em>not become a controversial public issue</em>&rsquo; (v.2, MSG).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He took with him two friends: Barnabas and Titus. Barnabas was a Jew and Titus was a Greek (an uncircumcised Gentile). For a first-century Jew there were two kinds of people in the world: Jewish and Greek (circumcised and uncircumcised). Circumcision was a sign that marked out a Jew, in accordance with God&rsquo;s command in Genesis 17:9&ndash;14. It signified God&rsquo;s covenant with his chosen people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, Paul chose Titus as one of his companions. &lsquo;Significantly, Titus, non-Jewish though he was, was not required to be circumcised&rsquo; (Galatians 2:3, MSG). Paul&rsquo;s point in the section that follows is that the Jerusalem apostles (James, Peter and John) agreed that the good news of Jesus Christ was for everyone: Jew and Gentile, circumcised and uncircumcised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul was forced to defend the &lsquo;freedom we have in Christ Jesus&rsquo; (v.4). True freedom is only found through faith in Christ. The necessity of circumcision for justification before God would &lsquo;make us slaves&rsquo; (v.4).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If they had yielded to the demands for circumcision of Gentile converts, they would have denied the very essence of the gospel. The purpose of this letter was to explain &lsquo;the <em>truth </em>of the gospel&rsquo; (v.5). Paul wanted to demonstrate that Jesus&rsquo; life, death and resurrection had fulfilled <em>all </em>the requirements of the law of Moses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting in Jerusalem was to resolve the circumcision question. The ruling reached was one of the most important ever made in the history of Christianity. The decision here prevented a ruinous division within the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only was the issue resolved, but also the gospel preached by Peter and Paul was firmly established as being <em>one and the same </em>(v.6). The leaders in Jerusalem recognised that Paul&rsquo;s apostleship bore all the marks of God-given authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter and the others accepted Paul and agreed a division of responsibility &ndash; Paul for the non-Jews and Peter for the Jews. The same gospel would be brought to two different spheres by different people. They shook hands on it as a sign that the agreement would be honoured (vv.7&ndash;9). This was a monumental moment for the early church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note that the parties had a sensible and detailed discussion about their differences. Paul refused to be overawed, although those he met were &lsquo;reputed to be pillars&rsquo; (v.9). This was, after all, quite a group to take on! James had presumably already become leader of the Jerusalem church. Peter and John were both members of Jesus&rsquo; inner circle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A pleasing agreement was reached. Paul seems to have acted with respect and courtesy despite being a determined man conscious of a special task. He would not allow opposition from without, nor discouragement from within, to stop him from doing what he felt called to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only condition that the Jerusalem leaders stipulated caused no problem for Paul: &lsquo;to remember the poor&rsquo; (v.10). The church must always prioritise the poor and disadvantaged in society.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Lord, as the church faces theological debates and a potential crisis of disunity, give us the skill, diplomacy and courage that the apostle Paul had. Help us to recognise that different people have different callings and different roles to play. Help us, like Paul, to embrace the entire church of Jesus Christ, and not add our own ideas and human requirements to what is needed to be a Christian.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n",

This is such an important incident in Israel&rsquo;s history that it appears three times in the Bible (see 2 Kings 18, 2 Chronicles 32). Sennacherib, King of Assyria, was attacking Jerusalem with a huge army. His minions were <em>taunting </em>the people, &lsquo;On what are you basing this confidence of yours?&rsquo; (Isaiah 36:4). They were being taunted and ridiculed for their faith in God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It must have been a terrifying situation. They were facing having to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine (v.12). They were told their God could not deliver them (v.15). No one else had ever been delivered out of the &lsquo;hand of the king of Assyria&rsquo; (v.18).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>King Hezekiah responded to the crisis by tearing his clothes, putting on sackcloth and going into the temple of the Lord (37:1). He sent for the prophet Isaiah. Hezekiah said, &lsquo;This is a black day. We&rsquo;re <em>in crisis</em>&rsquo; (v.3, MSG). Hezekiah asked Isaiah to pray (v.4).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isaiah responded by saying that God&rsquo;s message was: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be upset by what you&rsquo;ve heard ... I personally will take care of him&rsquo; (vv.6&ndash;7, MSG).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Hezekiah received a threatening letter, he went up to the house of the Lord, <em>spread it out before the Lord </em>and prayed: &lsquo;O Lord Almighty &hellip; you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. Give ear, O Lord, and hear; open your eyes, O Lord and see; listen to all the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God &hellip; Now, O Lord our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone, O Lord, are God&rsquo; (vv.14&ndash;20).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isaiah sent him a message, &lsquo;This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: <em>Because you have prayed to me </em>&hellip; I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant!&rsquo; (vv.21,35)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God heard the prayer of Hezekiah and Isaiah and he rescued and delivered his people (vv.36&ndash;38).</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Lord, we face a real crisis in our culture, our nation and our world. The name of Jesus is no longer honoured in our society. Lord, would you pour out a spirit of prayer and supplication on your people so that we may turn to you in prayer. Lord, hear our prayer and deliver us in this time of crisis.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n",
